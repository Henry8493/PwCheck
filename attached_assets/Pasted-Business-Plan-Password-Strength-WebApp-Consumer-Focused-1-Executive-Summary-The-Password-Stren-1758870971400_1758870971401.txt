Business Plan: Password Strength WebApp (Consumer Focused)

1. Executive Summary

The Password Strength WebApp is a fast, free, no-registration tool that checks password strength with a higher standard than ordinary meters. It differentiates itself with compliance-based scoring modes (NIST, GDPR, ISO 27001) and transparent methodologies, making it not just a gimmick but a trusted source for individuals, journalists, and security-aware users.

Vision: To become the most trusted password evaluation website on the internet — the “Grammarly for passwords,” but free and lightweight.

2. Problem Statement
	•	Most strength meters are simplistic, often misleading (e.g., rewarding “P@ssw0rd!”).
	•	Consumers rarely understand what makes a password secure, and existing advice is inconsistent.
	•	Users don’t want to register or install a password manager just to check strength.
	•	Compliance standards exist but are inaccessible to everyday users.

⸻

3. Solution

A browser-based password strength checker that:
	•	Runs entirely client-side (no data leaves the browser → privacy reassurance).
	•	Provides compliance-specific scoring modes (e.g., NIST SP 800-63B, GDPR minimums, PCI DSS).
	•	Offers actionable feedback (“Your password passes GDPR requirements but fails NIST due to length requirements”).
	•	Includes a secure password generator aligned with compliance settings.

No login, no tracking, no barrier to use.
